the goal of this script is to allow milkvr (video player for gear vr) to play 3d video files from a local or remote webserver.
the idea is stolen from https://github.com/abnormalend/milkvr-url-maker (create_url.sh did not work for me)
This script creates an index.html that you can open from your android browser and which should aks you to plugin your
phone into the gear vr so you can watch the file.
