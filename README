the goal of this script is to allow milkvr (video player for gear vr) to play 3d video files from a local or remote webserver.
the idea is stolen from https://github.com/abnormalend/milkvr-url-maker (create_url.sh did not work for me)
This script creates an index.html file with links to the video files in the directory that also contains the video files. Current script
assumes this is the root of your webserver.

http://localhost/index.html

You can open this from your android browser and which should aks you to plugin your
phone into the gear vr so you can watch the file. It requires ruby and has only been tested on ubuntu linux, but should work in any
environment. it also requires milvr installed on your samsung phone

The script assumes that you have a webserver running. Change localhost to the FQDN of your server.
If your video filename does not contain the 3d type, this script will assume it to be 3dh, which is probably wrong :)
